'''
You need to create the class Warrior, the instances of
which will have 2 parameters - health (equal to 50
points) and attack (equal to 5 points), and 1 property
- is_alive, which can be True (if warrior's health is
> 0) or False (in the other case). In addition you have
to create the second unit type - Knight, which should
be the subclass of the Warrior but have the increased
attack - 7. Also you have to create a function fight(),
which will initiate the duel between 2 warriors and
define the strongest of them. The duel occurs according
to the following principle:

Every turn one of the warriors will hit another one and
the last will lose his health in the same value as the
attack of the first warrior. After that, the second
warrior will do the same to the first one.
If in the end of the turn the first warrior has > 0
health and the other one doesnâ€™t, the function should
return True, in the other case it should return False.

Input: The warriors.

Output: The result of the duel (True or False).
