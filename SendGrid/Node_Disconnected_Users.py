Preface:
All nodes of GridLand are connected so one node can
send emails between the connected nodes. In such a
way, no matter how big the city is all users can
send messages to each other as long as all of the
nodes are connected.

When one of city nodes gets crushed it may leave
the citizens of this node district disconnected
from these emergency emails. It may also leave
districts around the crushed node disconnected if
their nodes do not have other ways to connect.

To resolve this occurrence, the Mayor uses mail-pigeons
â€“ an old method of sending mail that was invented
before the global internal network. All of the
citizens still connected to the network receive
the emergency emails, but the disconnected citizens
receive their messages from these pigeons.

Input:
4 args
- network structure showing connections (list)
- users of each node (dict)
- name of node that sends email
- crashed nodes (list)

Output:
Number of users who won't get an email
